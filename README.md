# Introduction
This is a sample web api creation using repository and unit of work patterns.
The repository and unit of work patterns are intended to create an abstraction layer between the data access layer and the business logic layer of an application. Implementing these patterns can help insulate applications from changes in the data store and can facilitate automated unit testing or test-driven development (TDD).

We need to implement a repository class for each entity type. For this example I chose the Student entity type and created a repository interface and a repository class.

1. Asp.net core / C#
2. Dependency injection
3. Entity framework database first approach
4. Repository pattern with UOW
